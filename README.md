Sometimes, I just want to view php files in a directory, without having to deal with an actual webserver.  [QuickPHP] looks pretty cool, but it's only for Windows.  This is currently an incredibly naive implementation (no, really, it's way more than you think), but I'm expecting to fix it up a little when I lose the will to do schoolwork.
